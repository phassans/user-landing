			<p><b>Last Updated on August 9,2018</b>. This Privacy Policy is effective<b> August 9, 2018</b> for all users.</p>
			<p>
				This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you in connection with your use of our
				s, including those offered through our websites, emails, and mobile applications (collectively, the <b>"Service"</b>). The terms <b>"we"</b>, <b>"us"</b>, and <b>"HungryHour"</b> refer to HungryHour, a company based in California. When you use the Service, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.<br />
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-12">
			<br />
			<h4>
				1. Introduction


			</h4>

			<p>
				Thank you for using HungryHour’s products, services, websites, and apps which are branded as “HungryHour”.
			</p>
			<p>
				These Terms of Use (“TOU”) contain the terms under which HungryHour and its affiliates provide their Services to you and describe how the Services may be accessed and used.
				We refer to the combination of these TOU and any applicable Additional Terms collectively as these “Terms.”
			</p>
			<p>
				You indicate your agreement to these Terms by clicking or tapping on a button indicating your acceptance of these Terms, by executing a document that references them, by creating a business account, or by using the Services.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you will be using the Services on behalf of an organization, you agree to these Terms on behalf of that organization and you represent that you have the authority to do so. In such case, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization.

				<b>
					1. Fees and Payments
				</b>
				<br />	<br />
				<b style="color:#808080;margin-left:15px;">1.1. Fees for Services.</b>

				<p style="margin-left:35px">You agree to pay to HungryHour any fees for each Service you purchase or use (including any overage fees), in accordance with the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that Service. Where applicable, you will be billed using the billing method you select through your account settings page. If you have elected to pay the fees by credit card, you represent and warrant that the credit card information you provide is correct and you will promptly notify HungryHour of any changes to such information. Fees paid by you are non-refundable, except as provided in these Terms or when required by law.</p>

				<br />	<br />
				<b style="color:#808080;margin-left:15px;">1.2. Subscriptions.</b>

				<p style="margin-left:35px">
					Some of our Services are billed on a subscription basis (we call these “Subscriptions”). This means that you will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis (each period is called a “billing cycle”). Billing cycles are typically monthly or annual, depending on what subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel auto-renewal through your online account management page, or by our team at itshungryhour@gmail.com. While we will be sad to see you go, you may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription at any time, in which case your Subscription will continue until the end of that billing cycle before terminating. You may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription immediately after the Subscription starts if you do not want it to renew.
				</p>
				<br />	<br />
				<b style="color:#808080;margin-left:15px;">
					1.3. Taxes.
				</b>

				<p style="margin-left:35px">
					Unless otherwise stated, you are responsible for any taxes (other than HungryHour’s income tax) or duties associated with the sale of the Services, including any related penalties or interest (collectively, “Taxes”). You will pay HungryHour for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If HungryHour is obliged to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to you, unless you provide HungryHour with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority or other documentation providing evidence that no tax should be charged. HungryHour will not charge you VAT if you provide us with a VAT number issued by a taxing authority in the European Union, are purchasing the Services from HungryHour Europe UC for business reasons, and are located in a different European Union member state from HungryHour Europe UC. If you are required by law to withhold any Taxes from your payments to HungryHour, you must provide HungryHour with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments.
				</p>
				<br />	<br />
				<b style="color:#808080;margin-left:15px;">
					1.4. Price Changes.

				</b>
				<p style="margin-left:35px">
					HungryHour may change the fees charged for the Services at any time, provided that, for Services billed on a subscription basis, the change will become effective only at the end of the then-current billing cycle of your Subscription. HungryHour will provide you with reasonable prior written notice of any change in fees to give you an opportunity to cancel your Subscription before the change becomes effective.

					(h) You may not engage in abusive or excessive usage of the Services, which is usage significantly in excess of average usage patterns that adversely affects the speed, responsiveness, stability, availability, or functionality of the Services for other users. HungryHour will endeavor to notify you of any abusive or excessive usage to provide you with an opportunity to reduce such usage to a level acceptable to HungryHour.

					(k) If your use of the Services requires you to comply with industry-specific regulations applicable to such use, you will be solely responsible for such compliance, unless HungryHour has agreed with you otherwise. You may not use the Services in a way that would subject HungryHour to those industry-specific regulations without obtaining HungryHour’s prior written agreement. For example, you may not use the Services to collect, protect, or otherwise handle “protected health information” (as defined in 45 C.F.R. §160.103 under United States federal regulations) without entering into a separate business associate agreement with HungryHour that permits you to do so.

					10.1. PCI Standards
				</b>

				<p style="margin-left:35px">
					If you use the Services to accept payment card transactions, you must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) to the extent they are applicable to your business (the “PCI Standards”). HungryHour provides tools to simplify your compliance with the PCI Standards, but you must ensure that your business is compliant and the specific steps you will need to take to comply with the PCI Standards will depend on your implementation of the Services.

					10.2. Cardholder Data.


				</b>

				<p style="margin-left:35px">
					HungryHour is responsible for the security of Cardholder Data that is collected, transmitted, stored, or processed by us on your behalf. “Cardholder Data” is defined as a cardholder’s primary account number, and where a full unmasked card number is present, any of the cardholder name, expiration date, and/or service code. HungryHour has developed strict security features to protect Cardholder Data, and as such this data may only be used in anticipated ways and stored in appropriate places. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE PROHIBITED FROM COLLECTING OR ENTERING CARDHOLDER DATA INTO ANY FORM OR DATA ENTRY FIELDS IN THE SERVICES, EXCEPT INTO THOSE FIELDS INTENDED SOLELY FOR THAT PURPOSE (i.e. where HungryHour explicitly enables such data to be entered into such fields). Appropriate fields are clearly marked with labels such as ‘Card number’ or by having a credit card icon precede them. Similarly, excluding payment forms, you must never collect or enter any “Sensitive Authentication Data”, as defined by the PCI Standards (including CVC or CVV2) into any fields in the Services. You assume all responsibility for any Cardholder Data entered into the Services in violation of these terms.

					11.1. By You.

				</b>

				<p style="margin-left:35px">
					You can terminate your Subscription at any time by contacting the HungryHour team at itshungryhour@gmail.com. Such termination will result in the deactivation or disablement of your account and access to it, and the deletion of content you collected through use of the Services. Terminations are confirmed immediately and you will not be charged again for that Subscription unless you purchase a new one. If you terminate a Subscription in the middle of a billing cycle, you will not receive a refund for any period of time you did not use in that billing cycle unless you are terminating these Terms for any of the following reasons: (a) we have materially breached these Terms and failed to cure that breach within 30 days after you have so notified us in writing; or (b) a refund is required by law.

						11.2. By HungryHour.

					</b>

				<p style="margin-left:35px">
					HungryHour may terminate your Subscription at the end of a billing cycle by providing at least 30 days’ prior written notice to you. HungryHour may terminate your Subscription for any reason by providing at least 90 days’ written notice to you and will provide a pro rata refund for any period of time you did not use in that billing cycle. HungryHour may suspend performance or terminate your Subscription for any of the following reasons: (a) you have materially breached these Terms and failed to cure that breach within 30 days after HungryHour has so notified you in writing; (b) you cease your business operations or become subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within 90 days; or (c) you fail to pay fees for 30 days past the due date. Additionally, HungryHour may limit, suspend, or terminate the Services to you: (i) if you fail to comply with these Terms, (ii) if you use the Services in a way that causes legal liability to us or disrupts others’ use of the Services; or (iii) if we are investigating suspected misconduct by you. Also, if we limit, suspend, or terminate the Services you receive, we will endeavor to give you advance notice and an opportunity to export a copy of your Content from that Service. However, there may be time sensitive situations where HungryHour may decide that we need to take immediate action without notice. HungryHour will use commercially reasonable efforts to narrow the scope and duration of any limitation or suspension under this Section as is needed to resolve the issue that prompted such action. HungryHour has no obligation to retain your Content upon termination of the applicable Service.

Notice of amendments may also be posted to HungryHour’s blog or upon your login to your account. Changes will be effective no sooner than the day they are publicly posted. In order for certain changes to become effective, applicable law may require HungryHour to obtain your consent to such changes, or to provide you with sufficient advance notice of them. If you do not want to agree to any changes made to the terms for a Service, you should stop using that Service, because by continuing to use the Services you indicate your agreement to be bound by the updated terms.

If HungryHour discontinues a Service, we will give you reasonable advance notice to provide you with an opportunity to export a copy of your Content from that Service.
